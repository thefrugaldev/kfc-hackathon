To run the application, add a Microsoft Cognitive Services speech SDK subscription key to `speech-service.js`. From the root, you can then run `yarn start` and navigate to `localhost:3000` to begin testing the application. 

NOTE: you'll need to allow microphone access on the web browser that you're testing on.
